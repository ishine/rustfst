Rust implementation of Weighted Finite States Transducers.

Rustfst is a library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching weighted
finite-state transducers (FSTs). Weighted finite-state transducers are automata where
each transition has an input label, an output label, and a weight.
The more familiar finite-state acceptor is represented as a transducer
with each transition's input and output label equal. Finite-state acceptors
are used to represent sets of strings (specifically, regular or rational sets);
finite-state transducers are used to represent binary relations between pairs of
strings (specifically, rational transductions). The weights can be used to represent
the cost of taking a particular transition.

FSTs have key applications in speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation,
optical character recognition, pattern matching, string processing, machine learning,
information extraction and retrieval among others. Often a weighted transducer is used to
represent a probabilistic model (e.g., an n-gram model, pronunciation model). FSTs can be
optimized by determinization and minimization, models can be applied to hypothesis sets
(also represented as automata) or cascaded by finite-state composition, and the best
results can be selected by shortest-path algorithms.

## Example

```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use rustfst::prelude::*;
use rustfst::algorithms::determinize::{DeterminizeType, determinize};
use rustfst::algorithms::rm_epsilon::rm_epsilon;
use std::sync::Arc;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Creates a empty wFST
    let mut fst = VectorFst::<TropicalWeight>::new();

    // Add some states
    let s0 = fst.add_state();
    let s1 = fst.add_state();
    let s2 = fst.add_state();

    // Set s0 as the start state
    fst.set_start(s0)?;

    // Add a transition from s0 to s1
    fst.add_tr(s0, Tr::new(3, 5, 10.0, s1))?;

    // Add a transition from s0 to s2
    fst.add_tr(s0, Tr::new(5, 7, 18.0, s2))?;

    // Set s1 and s2 as final states
    fst.set_final(s1, 31.0)?;
    fst.set_final(s2, 45.0)?;

    // Iter over all the paths in the wFST
    for p in fst.paths_iter() {
         println!("{:?}", p);
    }

    // A lot of operations are available to modify/optimize the FST.
    // Here are a few examples :

    // - Remove useless states.
    connect(&mut fst)?;

    // - Optimize the FST by merging states with the same behaviour.
    minimize(&mut fst, true)?;

    // - Copy all the input labels in the output.
    project(&mut fst, ProjectType::ProjectInput);

    // - Remove epsilon transitions.
    rm_epsilon(&mut fst)?;

    // - Compute an equivalent FST but deterministic.
    fst = determinize(Arc::new(fst), DeterminizeType::DeterminizeFunctional)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Status

A big number of algorithms are already implemented. The main one missing is the Composition.

## Benchmark with OpenFST

I did a benchmark some time ago on almost every linear fst algorithm and compared the results with `OpenFst`. You can find the results here :

- [Benchmark at the C++ level](https://github.com/Garvys/rustfst/blob/master/bench_results/bench_funct_80.md)
- [Benchmark at the CLI level](https://github.com/Garvys/rustfst/blob/master/bench_results/bench_cli_80.md)

Spoiler alert: `Rustfst` is faster on all those algorithms ðŸ˜…

For the other algorithms, i'm finishing the implementation then will do another round of benchmarks.

At the moment, the main algorithm missing in `Rustfst` is the composition that will be implemented shortly. All the important algorithms like minimization, determinization ... are already implemented but not benched and thus not (necessarily) optimized.
